# Name Analysis Flow Documentation

## Overview
The name analysis flow is a two-step process that analyzes audio input containing a name, first performing initial analysis and then applying corrections based on user input.

## Flow Execution Log Analysis

### Configuration Loading
```log
INFO:services.gemini_process:Loaded configuration 'name_correction' successfully.
INFO:services.gemini_process:Loaded configuration 'default_transcription' successfully.
INFO:services.gemini_process:Loaded configuration 'name_input' successfully.
- System successfully loaded all required prompt configurations
- Includes configurations for name input analysis and correction
### Step 1: Initial Name Analysis
```log
INFO:services.FlowExecutor:Executing step: name_input_analysis
INFO:services.gemini_process:Initialized Gemini GenerativeModel with prompt_type 'name_input'
 ```
```

- Session ID: step_name_input_analysis-d2a3d812-f89c-4b6b-9575-aac4aed666a0
- Initial analysis detected name as "Elijah Cornelius Sarbi"
- Confidence score: 95%
- Included psychoanalysis and prosody analysis
### Step 2: Name Correction
```log
INFO:services.FlowExecutor:Executing step: name_correction_analysis
INFO:services.gemini_process:Initialized Gemini GenerativeModel with prompt_type 'name_correction'
 ```
```

- Session ID: step_name_correction_analysis-1c7cf61b-4287-4a98-a4cc-33fd874fbaca
- Corrected name to "Elijah Cornelius Arbee"
- Increased confidence score to 98%
- Updated analysis based on corrected name

## Flow Characteristics
1. Two-Phase Analysis :
   
   - Initial transcription and analysis
   - Correction phase with user input
2. Metadata Tracking :
   
   - Each step maintains unique session IDs
   - Flow-level session tracking
   - Step-level session tracking
3. Analysis Components :
   
   - Name transcription
   - Confidence scoring
   - Environmental analysis
   - Psychological assessment
   - Speech pattern analysis
## Technical Notes
- Uses Gemini AI model for processing
- Maintains session consistency throughout flow
- Successfully handles audio input (OGG format)
- Processes external variables for name correction
- Generates comprehensive analysis including psychological and environmental factors
## Warning Note
The test completed successfully, though there was a gRPC shutdown warning that can be safely ignored:

```log
WARNING: All log messages before absl::InitializeLog() is called are written to STDERR
